#Variables, Constants, and Storing Data
syntax for creating a variable --> let NAME = VALUE; (js)
let is the declaration and Value is the assignment
when changing the VALIUE, no longer need to declare.
Example:
let dog = 1
Chris gets another dog
dog = 2 --> didn't need to use 'let' again
End Example
can be a string, number, or boolean

If you try to change a constant after it has been declared, it will give you an error
